/--
Defines the equality comparison between two units, which always returns `True`.

In Noir, this builtin corresponds to `a == b` for values `a`, `b` of type `Unit`.

  (fun _ => true)

/--
Defines the equality comparison between two booleans.

In Noir, this builtin corresponds to `a == b` for values `a`, `b` of type `bool`.
