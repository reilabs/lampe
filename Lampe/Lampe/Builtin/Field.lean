/--
For a prime `p`, a field element `a : Fp p`, and a bit size `w : U 32`,
this builtin evaluates to `()` if and only if `a < 2^w`, i.e., it can be represented by `w` bits.
Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

In Noir, this builtin corresponds to `fn __assert_max_bit_size(self, bit_size: u32)` implemented for `Field`.

/--
For a prime `p`, a field element `a : Fp p`, this builtin evaluates to the number of bits of `p`.
We asdecomposeWithRadix `log p + 1 < 2^64`, i.e., `p`'s size can be represented by a uint of bit-size `64`.
Otherwise, this builtin throws an exception.

In Noir, this builtin corresponds to `fn modulus_num_bits() -> u64` implemented for `Field`.

For a prime `p`, a field element `a : Fp p`, this builtin evaluates to the bit representation of `p` in little-endian format.

/--
Represents the builtin that converts a field element to an unsigned integer.

Assume a B-bit integer. Noir's semantics for this conversion take the field element and truncate it
to its least-significant B bits. This value is then interpreted as the unsigned integer element. In
Noir, this builtin corresponds to `fn from_field(a: Field) -> T` implemented for uints of bit size
`s`.

Represents the builtin that converts a field element to an integer.

Assume a B-bit integer. Noir's semantics for this conversion take the field element and truncate it
to its least-significant B bits. This value is then interpreted as the signed integer element. In
Noir, this builtin corresponds to `fn from_field(a: Field) -> T` implemented for ints of bit size
`s`.

/--
Represents the builtin that converts an unsigned integer into a field element.

Noir's semantics for this conversion take the unsigned integer and zero-extend it up to the size of
the field. We do this by taking our unsigned int as an arbitrary `i ∈ ℤ` and then convert this to a
field element by zero extending. In Noir, this builtin corresponds to `fn as_field(self) -> Field` 
implemented for uints of bit size `s`.

Integers are also internally represented as field elements with an additional restriction that all
integer widths `X` are defined such that `iX::MAX < p`, the field prime. This means that we can
unconditionally perform this conversion without care for larger values. To ensure totality, we wrap
when converting, as that case should never be encountered.

  -- It is not truly sign-extending as that has no semantic meaning in ℕ, but we get the correct
  -- semantics for our operation by doing so. We then rely on a coercion from ℕ to our field, the
  -- source of which can be viewed with `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance`.
