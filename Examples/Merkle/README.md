# Example 1

This is an example of a full end-to-end implementation and verification of a Noir program using
Lampe.

Make sure to run `lake exe cache get` before `lake build`ing to avoid manually re-compiling Mathlib.

First run run `/path/to/lampe/cli --root src --out-file Example1/Extracted.lean` from the root
directory of this project (where this `README` is located) to extract.
